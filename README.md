# Credits and History
This package is actually built based on [Marketplace](https://github.com/SecTheater/marketplace) package by [SecTheater](https://github.com/SecTheater) which was started as a forked solution on a project. Then, along the way I found that the package has several unfriendly and non-movable setup like how the users table needed to be modified and the users permission function that's a bit hard to modify. So, from forked repository I decided to rebuild the package with my knowledge thinking that this package would be needed to be a starting engine in any e-commerce projects by any developers in the world.

The plan is to have this package packe with basic but customizable features, for example:
1. B2B system that supports multivendor shops where each shop can have their own store url. Although, this package can also be used to serve as a single store ecommerce solution.
2. Coupons system that can be sold as a product or as a gift from a vendor to a customer.
3. Discount system that can automatically calculate price before/after tax, per product or per total cart amount based, and modified by each vendor.
4. Many more to add.
